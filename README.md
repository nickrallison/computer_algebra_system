## Description
In progress but working on making a symbolic math engine in rust. Can currently take input & simplify & expand terms to make finding equivalencies easy as well as solving analytically.

## Goal
I want to make a working computer algebra system on a TI84: (https://github.com/maddymakesgames/Rust-CE0)[TI 84 Compiler]
