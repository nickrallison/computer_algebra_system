# computer_algebra_system

## Description
In progress but working on making a symbolic math engine in rust. Can currently take input & simplify & expand terms to make finding equivalencies easy as well as solving analytically.

## Goal
I want to make a working computer algebra system on a TI 84: [TI 84 Compiler](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/Rust-CE0)
